# Features

## Existing Features

![website](documentation/readme-images/game.JPG)

### Heading of the Game

![title](documentation/readme-images/titleofthegame.JPG)

You can tell exactly what the game is about from the page heading.

### Game Description

![description](documentation/readme-images/description.JPG)

A synopsis of how the game is played.
Without being overbearing with information, this will help new players quickly grasp how the game is played.

### Start Game

![startbutton](documentation/readme-images/startbutton.JPG)  ![startbutton-hover](documentation/readme-images/startbutton-hover.JPG) 

- In order to begin the game, you must press the start game button. All of the Alphabet images will appear and timer will start once you click the Start Game button.
- This allows the player to launch a game whenever they want.
- The hover effect on the button is a helpful visual cue.

### Reset Game

![resetbutton](documentation/readme-images/resetbutton.JPG)  ![restbutton-hover](documentation/readme-images/resetbutton-hover.JPG)
 
It is simple for the user to reset the entire game area with a single button press thanks to the button's multiple built-in functions:

- The alphabet images are replaced with fresh, randomly arranged ones when the board is reset.
- The alphabet images that were colored by clicks in the previous game are now reset to their original colors.
- The timer is reset to 0 seconds.
- Playing a new game requires pressing reset and start again because it ends the current one.
- The alphabetical order in which they should be clicked is also reset by it.
Reset must be pressed after the game is over in order to begin a new one.

This allows the user to take a moment to consider the game they just finished before the game area is reset.
The hover effect on the reset button provides a useful visual cue for the user.

### Alphabets

All of the Alphabet images will appear and timer will start once Start Game button is clicked.
![alphabets](documentation/readme-images/alphabets.JPG)

#### Correct Click

- The alphabet is arranged randomly, with a new placement for every game.
- By doing this, the game stays unpredictable and ensures that each game presents a fresh challenge.
- The backdrop will turn green when the clicks are made in the right order.
![correct](documentation/readme-images/correct.JPG)

#### Incorrect Click

- A quick and simple method for the player to verify that they selected the right alphabet.
- A mistaken click will cause the background to turn red.
- A simple method for the player to realize that they selected the wrong alphabet.
![incorrect](documentation/readme-images/incorrect.JPG)

### Timer

- The game will launch the timer.
- The timer gives the player a competitive element, which increases the user's interest in the game.
- When the game is over or finished, it stops.
- Helpful in letting the player know how quickly they finished the current game.
- Resets upon pressing the reset button.
- It's simple for the user to reset everything relevant between games with a single button.
![timer](documentation/readme-images/timer.JPG)  ![timerstart](documentation/readme-images/timerstart.JPG)

### Your Best Time

- The first game finished will be recorded on the screen, giving subsequent attempts a benchmark.
- The addition of a timer to the player's arsenal should make for an entertaining gameplay feature.
- When the game is over, the best time feature looks at the timer's value. If you beat your previous record, it will record your new best time on the screen.
- The user should feel proud of themselves because they beat their own record.
![besttime](documentation/readme-images/yourbesttime.JPG)  ![newbesttime](documentation/readme-images/yourbesttimestart.JPG)

### Footer

The footer is visible at the bottom of the page so that social media links always available to the user.
![footer](documentation/readme-images/footer.JPG)

 Below all these there is a disclaimer for copyright.
![disclaimer](documentation/readme-images/disclaimer.JPG)

## Future Features

A variety of difficulty settings would be included in the finished game. 

- A timer with intervals of 30, 45 and 60seconds is included in each increasingly difficult level.
- It would be more difficult to remember which alphabets have already been clicked if the colors were taken off of them when the hardest setting is selected.
- The absence of visual cues would make it more difficult to locate the alphabets you're looking for.
- Log In- If you want to save your score, you might need to log in.
- Sound effects are optional.

Alternative might be used like colors or numbers in place of alphabets.

# Bugs

## Known Bugs

### Bug1

- When running my code through jshint, I got a warning saying: 

'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

'for of' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

### Bug2

- When running my code through jshint, I got a warning saying: 

One warning

66	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (handleImageClick)

### Bug3

- When running my code through jshint, I got a warning saying:

One unused variable

14	startGame

### Bug4

- During manual testing, the timer was running fast and the timer was was always set to 1 even after Reset Game.

## Fixed Bugs

### Bug1

After researching on Google added these two comments at the start of script.js
/* eslint-env es6 */
/* jshint esversion: 6 */

Now this bug has been fixed.

### Bug4

Made changes in the function resetGame() code.

Now this bug has been fixed.

## Unfixed Bugs

### Bug2

- When running my code through jshint, I got a warning saying: 

One warning

66	Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (handleImageClick)

I tried to add fix it with another function but it led to other errors and it didn't work as expected. So, I left as it is, as it is not affecting the total functionally of the game.

### Bug3

- When running my code through jshint, I got a warning saying:

One unused variable

14	startGame

I tried to add if and else conditional statements instead of function(), but it didn't work as expected and led to others errors. So, I left as it is, as it is not affecting the total functionally of the game.
